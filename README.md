# Merge Calculator

This is a site to allow you to calculate how many items of a specific level you need to create in order to make enough of the specified level items.
This can be used for games like Merge Magic, Top War, or Merge Dragons.

The formlua used is as follows:

(numberOfItemsToMerge^(desiredItemlevel - currentItemLevel)) * (numberOfItemsToCreate / itemsCreatedPerMerge)
